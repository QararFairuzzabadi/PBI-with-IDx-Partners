## Background
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Georgia', cursive, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">
This task is part of the final task as a Data Scientist in the Project Based Internship program by ID/X Partners. The main focus of this assignment is to develop a machine learning solution that can be used to accurately predict credit risk. The project is based on a dataset that includes complete information about loans, both approved and rejected, along with various variables related to borrower characteristics and loan details. The main objective of this project is to build a classification model that is not only able to identify potential defaults early, but can also be used as a basis for decision-making in the lending process. With this data-driven approach, the company is expected to manage its loan portfolio more effectively, reduce default rates, and improve the overall quality of risk management.
